| Syntax  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?`     | Matches any single character.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `*`     | Matches zero or more characters, except for path separators (e.g. `/`).                                                                                                                             |
| `**`    | Matches zero or more characters, including path separators. Must match a complete path segment (i.e. followed by a `/` or the end of the pattern).                                                  |
| `[ab]`  | Matches one of the characters contained in the brackets. Character ranges, e.g. `[a-z]` are also supported. Use `[!ab]` or `[^ab]` to match any character _except_ those contained in the brackets. |
| `{a,b}` | Matches one of the patterns contained in the braces. Any of the wildcard characters can be used in the sub-patterns. Braces may be nested up to 10 levels deep.                                     |
| `!`     | When at the start of the glob, this negates the result. Multiple `!` characters negate the glob multiple times.                                                                                     |
| `\`     | A backslash character may be used to escape any of the above special characters.                                                                                                                    |
